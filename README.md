Nonprofit Starter Pack - Signup Org Metadata
=================================================

The Nonprofit Starter Pack is available both via a trial signup located on the Salesforce Foundation's [website](http://www.salesforcefoundation.org/tryitnow) as 
well as via the [Appexchange](http://www.appexchange.com).  When signing up and manually configuring an organization using the Appexchange setup, some additional
pieces of metadata are not available.  This repository contains those pieces of metadata and can be used to more quickly deploy those metadata items, as opposed to 
manually creating them.  The metadata included here is listed below.

**Included Metadata**

* Custom profiles
* Custom roles
* Custom page layouts for standard objects (Account, Campaign, Contact and two Opportunity layouts)
* Custom home page layout
* Custom apps for standard CRM/Donor Management and for Settings

Manual configuration of this metadata can also be done by following the instructions provided [here](http://salesforcefoundation.screenstepslive.com/s/npsp/m/install_uninstall/l/42128-installing-the-nonprofit-starter-pack).
